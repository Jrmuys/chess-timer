# Chess Timer

The goal of this project was to create a compact and satisfying chess timer to play over-the-board chess games with time control. It uses an arduino nano as the brains, two small OLED displays to show the time and configure the game, and three cherry mx switches to control the timer, all within a small 3d printed case.
